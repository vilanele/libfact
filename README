Libfact uses pari/gp and provides functions to deal with generalized
factorial functions and related objects.

There are two documentation for the library in doc:
    - libfact-doc.pdf        a talkative documentation with references
                             and examples in gp-code

    - libfact-quickdoc.pdf   a quick documentatino only listing and
                             explaining  proposed functions
                             

Building libfact is straightforward : just run make. 
It will produce three files :

    - a static library libfact.a
    - a shared library libfact.so 
    - a gp-script      libfact.gp

You can now use the library. Just include libfact.h in your source
files and link to the desired library. 
To use the library within a gp-session, just read "libfact.gp" 
within gp. 
You can move the script "libfact.gp" around but if you do so with 
the shared library file "libfact.so", don't forget to update the 
absolute path in the first line of the script "libfact.gp".
