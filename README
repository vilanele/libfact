Please see the joined documentation to learn about libfact.

Building libfact is straightforward : just run make. 
It will produce three files :

    - a static library libfact.a
    - a shared library libfact.so 
    - a gp-script      libfact.gp

You can now use the library. Just include libfact.h in your source
files and link to the desired library. To use the library within a
gp-session, just read "libfact.gp" within gp. You can move the script
"libfact.gp" around but if you do so with the shared library file 
"libfact.so", don't forget to update the absolute path in the first 
line of the script "libfact.gp".
